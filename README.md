# try-streamlit üíÉüèº
This demo accompanies a talk on getting the most out of GitHub Copilot.
In this dem, I try out streamlit for the first time with a little help from GitHub Copilot.


## Local Dev ‚öíÔ∏è

### To try this demo yourself:
1. fork and clone this repository
2. open the notebook in your editor
3. open up GitHub Copilot Chat do the following:

```
- Ask: Can I use streamlit in this app? (create a new file with the suggestions)
- Ask: How do I install it? (if instructions weren't initially provided)
- Accept suggestions and open up app in browser
- Ask: What else can I do with Streamlit and my #flights.csv data? (attach csv file) to conversation
- Accept suggestions and verify app still works in broswer
- Ask as many questions as you want about streamlit and implement the suggestions to learn more.
